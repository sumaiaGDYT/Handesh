            <h2>Baking is my passion</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>I love to bake any pastries/sweets but mostly brownies. Baking or even being in the kitchen
                at my house is more than just the ingredients or utensils. I use it as a way of spending
                time with my sisters, mom, and aunts. My sisters are younger than me and not going to lie it gets
                a bit infuriating when the middle sister tells me what to do, but it's good. When I was younger I
                used to watch my mom and aunts make <I>handesh</I> also known as 'teler pithas'. They are a sweet treat 
                which can be eaten as a snack. I was introduced to baking sweet treats/snacks when I was in elementary school. My mom and aunts would make
                <b>handesh</b> for the EID after Ramadan. 
            </p>
            <p> I would secretly eat the raw mix of the handesh, and it started when
                I was a toddler and my second aunt would feed me raw mix. I have sweet tooths and it taste really good. My mom and aunt
                inspire and still inspire me to bake mostly because of the time we spend baking treats/snacks. We would start with a normal
                conversation about literally anything and it would smoothy shift to when I was younger or my siblings/cousins and what we would 
                do, then to when they were younger. I love listening to their stories from <b>'back in their day'.</b> To the present day,
                whenever I get stuck I would ask my mom for help and after she's done helping me; she would tell me how I relate to her siblings
                when they were in their late teenage to mid adult years. Like I wrote before, I use baking as a way spending time with my family
                to hear their stories and learning more about them than what I already know.
